==========
The PGx-Doc-Samples Git repository contains a subset of the documentation I developed during my time on the VA PHASER (VA Pharmacogenomic Testing for Veterans) project as a contract employee working for the Institute for Medical Research (https://imr.org/) VA Health Care facility located in Durham, NC, in the roles of National Deployment Coordinator and later as National Project Support lead. Success of this early project paved the way for the incorporation of PGx (pharmacogenomic) testing as a standard feature of VA healthcare delivery.  

Thanks to the success of the PHASER pilot project team of which I was a member, it was superceded beginning in 2023 by a fully funded organization staffed by VA full time employees.  The pilot project was successful at meeting its goal of deploying PGx testing to over 100 VA facilities across the US.  

The documents in the repository include a mix of end user, deployment, and technical implementation details.  These examples illustrate my ability to develop doucumentaion with different content aimed at different audiences.  

Although examples are not included in this package, I also developed short training videos for clinicians, lab staff, and others using TechSmith's Camtasia product.

PHASER Program Overview
=======================
PHASER is currently an active clinical precision-medicine program across a growing number of VA medical centers. It continues to be implemented in routine care — not a research trial — and supports individualized medication decisions using genetic data. Several VA sites now provide it to enrolled Veterans, and it’s part of the broader VA strategy to expand pharmacogenomics and precision medicine services.
